# Volta Labs Hackathon.001

## JumperMan is a game created by Fun Society at the first Volta Labs Hackathon sponsored by the Atlantic Lottery Corporation. The theme was probability and randomness.
### We took 1st place and the grand prize of $2000

Jumperman can jump off of walls to reach the top of the level - except the levels are infinite and procedurally generated. Have fun!
