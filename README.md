# Volta Labs Hackathon.001 Entry by Fun Society - "JumperMan"

### JumperMan is a game created by Fun Society at the first Volta Labs Hackathon sponsored by the Atlantic Lottery Corporation. The theme was probability and randomness. We took home the first place prize of $2000

Jumperman can jump off of walls to reach the top of the level - except the levels are infinite and procedurally generated. Have fun!
